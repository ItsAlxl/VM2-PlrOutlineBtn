description = "Do you want to know where your friends are in a pinch, but the constant outlines break your immersion? This mod lets you push a button to change the outlines at will. It now also lets you customize outline colors!

Open your VMF mod settings (press F4 by default) to change which outline modes the mod will switch between and set the keybind for switching them. You can decide between a toggling key or a held key.

You can change the color used for allies, downed allies, interactable items (pickups, levers, bricks, candles, etc.), and tagged entities.

Be sure that you are subscribed to the Vermintide Mod Framework and it is above this mod in the load order!
